<h3>
<a id="features" class="anchor" href="#features" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Create an infinite number of profiles, each with an infinite number of services, each of which with an infinite number of accounts.</li>
<li>Cross-platform, coded in C# and fully functional in both .NET and Mono. Invium will run and behave in the exact same way across the following operating systems: Windows, Linux, MacOS.</li>
<li>Strong cryptography technologies involved (AES 256-bit, SHA-512 and PBKDF2 key derivation) ensure cracking the data is going to be time consuming and very costly.</li>
<li>Support for on-the-fly language switching.</li>
<li>Very intuitive, easy to use interface.</li>
<li>Incredibly small; Invium itself is a single-file product. One executable. Not counting the data file that is created when you start using it; the data file that holds your actual information.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="what-invium-is-not" class="anchor" href="#what-invium-is-not" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What Invium is NOT</h3>

<ul>
<li>Invium is not as feature rich as some other password managers you can find online.

<ul>
<li>It will not integrate with your webbrowser.</li>
<li>There is no app for it for any mobile device.</li>
<li> It does not sync anything with any form of cloud.

<ul>
<li> For the time being, I would suggest <a href="http://www.getsync.com/">BitTorrent Sync</a> to start syncing Invium between multiple PCs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Invium is not a substitute to common sense.

<ul>
<li> Do not access your most sensitive and key accounts from public PCs or essentially any PC that you do not own; it simply is common sense not to trust that which you do not own, who knows what's been installed?</li>
<li> No amount of precautionary measures on my part will ever cover every possible contingency; I cannot possibly predict or code against every possible loophole or security leak, particularly not those left by poor PC management. In short: Ensure your PC is clean of virusses or any other form of malware/spyware and keep it that way.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<a id="getting-invium" class="anchor" href="#getting-invium" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Getting Invium</h3>

<p>Getting Invium is very simple.</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="https://github.com/Altorffer/Invium/releases">this page</a>
</li>
<li>Download the version appropriate to your OS and architecture. There are 32-bit and 64-bit downloads for Windows, Linux and MacOS.</li>
<li>Place the downloaded executable in a folder of your chosing; there is no installation procedure involved.</li>
<li>(Optional) Create a shortcut for it in whatever way you feel comfortable with.</li>
<li>Start using it, you're done!</li>
</ol>

<h3>
<a id="compiling-invium" class="anchor" href="#compiling-invium" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Compiling Invium</h3>

<p>For those interested in a more hands-on approach, compiling Invium should be relatively straightforward.</p>

<ol>
<li>From <a href="https://github.com/Altorffer/Invium">this page</a> either clone the project using Git or just download the .ZIP.</li>
<li>Open the solution (Invium.sln) in your favourite IDE (it has been compiled successfully in both Visual Studio Express as well as MonoDevelop).</li>
<li>From the configurations menu (where you are able to select which configuration to use for the build) pick whichever platform you are building it for.

<ul>
<li>.NET or Mono (both available in AnyCPU and x64)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Build it and you should be able to find the executable in the Invium/bin subfolder of wherever you cloned/extracted Invium to.</li>
<li>Copy that executable to wherever you want and run it.</li>
<li>(Optional) Create a shortcut for it in whatever way you feel comfortable with.</li>
<li>Start using it, you're done!</li>
</ol>

<p>Want to help develop Invium? If so, feel free to <a href="https://github.com/Altorffer/Invium">fork</a> the project and start coding and hitting me with pull requests. Personally I would recommend Linux + MonoDevelop for the development. As far as the coding style is concerned; it is based on on-the-fly code formatting by MonoDevelop in conjunction with some tweaked StyleCop settings and it will be enforced. So expect any accepted pull request to go through some formatting changes.</p>

<p>I could specifically use a hand with the translations. The infrastructure is there for on-the-fly language switching. See Language.cs in the project for information on how to add translations.</p>

{"name":"PinCushion","tagline":"","body":"## Invium, a password manager in C&#35;\r\n\r\nCopyright &copy; 2013, 2014 Armin Altorffer\r\n\r\nInvium is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nInvium is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See [the GNU General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) for more details.\r\n\r\n### Features:\r\n\r\n- Create an infinite number of profiles, each with an infinite number of services, each of which with an infinite number of accounts.\r\n- Cross-platform, coded in C&#35; and fully functional in both .NET and Mono. Invium will run and behave in the exact same way across the following operating systems: Windows, Linux, MacOS.\r\n- Strong cryptography technologies involved (AES 256-bit, SHA-512 and PBKDF2 key derivation) ensure cracking the data is going to be time consuming and very costly.\r\n- Support for on-the-fly language switching.\r\n- Very intuitive, easy to use interface.\r\n- Incredibly small; Invium itself is a single-file product. One executable. Not counting the data file that is created when you start using it; the data file that holds your actual information.\r\n\r\n### What Invium is NOT\r\n\r\n- Invium is not as feature rich as some other password managers you can find online.\r\n    - It will not integrate with your webbrowser.\r\n    - There is no app for it for any mobile device.\r\n    -  It does not sync anything with any form of cloud.\r\n        -  For the time being, I would suggest [BitTorrent Sync](http://www.getsync.com/) to start syncing Invium between multiple PCs.\r\n-  Invium is not a substitute to common sense.\r\n    -  Do not access your most sensitive and key accounts from public PCs or essentially any PC that you do not own; it simply is common sense not to trust that which you do not own, who knows what's been installed?\r\n    -  No amount of precautionary measures on my part will ever cover every possible contingency; I cannot possibly predict or code against every possible loophole or security leak, particularly not those left by poor PC management. In short: Ensure your PC is clean of virusses or any other form of malware/spyware and keep it that way.\r\n\r\n### Getting Invium\r\n\r\nGetting Invium is very simple.\r\n\r\n1. Go to [this page](https://github.com/Altorffer/Invium/releases)\r\n2. Download the version appropriate to your OS and architecture. There are 32-bit and 64-bit downloads for Windows, Linux and MacOS.\r\n3. Place the downloaded executable in a folder of your chosing; there is no installation procedure involved.\r\n4. (Optional) Create a shortcut for it in whatever way you feel comfortable with.\r\n5. Start using it, you're done!\r\n\r\n### Compiling Invium\r\n\r\nFor those interested in a more hands-on approach, compiling Invium should be relatively straightforward.\r\n\r\n1. From [this page](https://github.com/Altorffer/Invium) either clone the project using Git or just download the .ZIP.\r\n2. Open the solution (Invium.sln) in your favourite IDE (it has been compiled successfully in both Visual Studio Express as well as MonoDevelop).\r\n3. From the configurations menu (where you are able to select which configuration to use for the build) pick whichever platform you are building it for.\r\n  * .NET or Mono (both available in AnyCPU and x64)\r\n4. Build it and you should be able to find the executable in the Invium/bin subfolder of wherever you cloned/extracted Invium to.\r\n5. Copy that executable to wherever you want and run it.\r\n6. (Optional) Create a shortcut for it in whatever way you feel comfortable with.\r\n7. Start using it, you're done!\r\n\r\n### Contributing to the development of Invium\r\n\r\nWant to help develop Invium? If so, feel free to [fork](https://github.com/Altorffer/Invium) the project and start coding and hitting me with pull requests. Personally I would recommend Linux + MonoDevelop for the development. As far as the coding style is concerned; it is based on on-the-fly code formatting by MonoDevelop in conjunction with some tweaked StyleCop settings and it will be enforced. So expect any accepted pull request to go through some formatting changes.\r\n\r\nI could specifically use a hand with the translations. The infrastructure is there for on-the-fly language switching. See Language.cs in the project for information on how to add translations.","google":"UA-57637957-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}

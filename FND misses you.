Good morning, mr. Altorffer.

I googled your name and this GitHub profile was the most recent search result, so I decided to leave you a file here, because I don't have any other means of contacting you.
Haven't spoken to you in a while, or a few years is more like it. I want to change that. 
I tried sending a mail to the email I knew, kharay@gmail.com, but that email doesn't seem to exist anymore.
Please, send me an email at dimergon@gmail.com. I miss you.

Sincerely,
Alexander Benjamin Stensland

From [this page](https://github.com/Altorffer/PinCushion) either clone the project using Git or just download the .ZIP.\r\n\r\n2. Open the solution (PinCushion.sln) in your favourite IDE (it has been compiled successfully in both Visual Studio Express as well as MonoDevelop).\r\n\r\n3. From the configurations menu (where you are able to select which configuration to use for the build) pick whichever platform you are building it for.\r\n  * .NET or Mono (both available in AnyCPU and x64)\r\n\r\n4. Build it and you should be able to find the executable in the PinCushion/bin subfolder of wherever you cloned/extracted PinCushion to.\r\n\r\n5. Copy that executable to wherever you want and run it, as you're done! Well, it is a single file product (not counting the data file in which your personal data will be stored), what did you expect?","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

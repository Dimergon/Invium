<a id="features" class="anchor" href="#features" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features:</h1>

<ul>
<li>Create an infinite number of profiles, each with an infinite number of services, each of which with an infinite number of accounts.</li>
<li>Cross-platform, coded in C# and fully functional in both .NET and Mono.</li>
<li>Data is encrypted both on disk and in memory with AES 256-bit in conjunction with SHA512 hashes although in-memory encryption is only enabled on Windows as ram scrapers are unlikely on Linux and other *nix platforms supported by Mono.</li>
<li>Targeting .NET 4.5 to avoid compatibility with depricated and unsupported operating systems such as Windows XP.</li>
<li>Very intuitive, easy to use interface.</li>
</ul>

<p>Compiling PinCushion should be relatively straightforward.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>From <a href="https://github.com/Altorffer/PinCushion">this page</a> either clone the project using Git or just download the .ZIP.</p></li>
<li><p>Open the solution (PinCushion.sln) in your favourite IDE (it has been compiled successfully in both Visual Studio Express as well as MonoDevelop).</p></li>
<li>
<p>From the configurations menu (where you are able to select which configuration to use for the build) pick whichever platform you are building it for.</p>

<ul>
<li>.NET or Mono (both available in AnyCPU and x64)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Build it and you should be able to find the executable in the PinCushion/bin subfolder of wherever you cloned/extracted PinCushion to.</p></li>
<li><p>Copy that executable to wherever you want and run it, as you're done! Well, it is a single file product (not counting the data file in which your personal data will be stored), what did you expect?</p></li>
